# Face-Detection
As part of my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Exeter, I completed a comprehensive project in Computer Vision, covering a wide range of techniques and applications.


Gradient Computation:

Developed functions to compute gradient magnitude and direction for image processing.
Enhanced edge detection and feature extraction.
Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) Spatial Histograms:

Created algorithms for spatial histograms, improving object recognition and classification accuracy.
Rotation Matrix Calculation:

Implemented methods to compute rotation matrices for shape transformations.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

Trained and tested a ResNet model on the EXCV10 dataset.
Achieved notable accuracy in image classification tasks.
Masked Face Detection:

Designed and evaluated a multi-class detector for identifying mask-wearing conditions.
Skills Utilized:

Python, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch
OpenCV for image processing
Analytical and problem-solving skills
Outcome:
Successfully completed the project with high marks, demonstrating practical applications of computer vision techniques in real-world scenarios.
